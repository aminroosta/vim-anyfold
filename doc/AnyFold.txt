1. Introduction                                               *AnyFoldIntroduction*

AnyFold allows quick navigation and focus in files that are structured by
indentation. Its folding mechanism is generic and works equally well for any
language. Folds based on indented blocks are very useful to reveal the logical
structure of a complex file and to hide irrelevant information.

To get an idea of how it works and why it is so useful, you need to try it
yourself. Nonetheless, here comes a rough description of how folds are defined:
each line followed by a hanging indent starts a new fold. A fold is closed by
the next line with the same indent as the first line of the fold. The actual
indents present in a file are carefully postprocessed to ensure that every fold
contain exactly one logical block of code. AnyFold can handle many corner cases
such as comments, empty lines and varying indentation widths.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                         *AnyFoldUsage*

AnyFold needs to be activated by adding one line to your vimrc:

* AnyFold active for all filetypes
    let g:anyfold_activate=1

* AnyFold active for a specific filetype
    autocmd Filetype <your-filetype> let g:anyfold_activate=1

For dealing with folds in general, see |fold-commands|, |fold-options| and
|fold-behavior|. Additionally, AnyFold defines the following mappings:

  <Space>       Toggle folds. Behaves as "zO" if cursor on closed folds and
                as "zc" if cursor in open fold.

    [[          Move to the beginning of the current block.      *AnyFoldMotion*
    ]]          Move to the end of the current block.
    ]k          Move to the end of the previous block.
    [j          Move to the beginning of the next block.

When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times. Commands can be used
after an operator.

The move commands are very similar to the default fold
motion commands "[z", "]z", "zj", "zk" but they are more intuitive for indented
blocks. More specifically, the first line of a block is defined as the first
line in a fold and the last line of a block as the next line after the last
line in a fold.

Since AnyFold can not correctly fold mismatched indentation, auto-indenting
is highly recommended. See |equalprg|.

                                                              *AnyFoldComments*
If comments are left unindented, indent folding produces wrong results. In this
case you need to set
    let g:anyfold_identify_comments = 1

such that comments are identified and ignored. Note that this feature may lead
to slow performance for large files.

3. Configuration and Options                            *AnyFoldConfiguration*
                                                             *AnyFoldOptions*
For more control over mappings and features, AnyFold provides the following
options. These can be set either globally
    let <option>=<value>

or filetype specific
    autocmd Filetype <filetype> let <option>=<value>

Option                      | Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
g:anyfold_fold_display      | Minimalistic display of closed folds
g:anyfold_toggle_key        | Key to toggle folds
g:anyfold_motion            | Map motion commands (|AnyFoldMotion|)
g:anyfold_auto_reload       | Automatically update folds
g:anyfold_identify_comments | Identify (and ignore) comment lines
g:anyfold_fold_comments     | Fold multiline comments
g:anyfold_fold_toplevel     | Fold subsequent unindented lines

Option                      | Type    | Default value               *AnyFoldDefaults*
----------------------------------------------------------------------
g:anyfold_fold_display      | 0, 1    | 1 (= 'on')
g:anyfold_toggle_key        | string  | '<Space>'
g:anyfold_motion            | 0, 1    | 1 (= 'on')
g:anyfold_auto_reload       | 0, 1    | 1 (= 'on')
g:anyfold_identify_comments | 0, 1    | 1 (= 'on')
g:anyfold_fold_comments     | 0, 1    | 0 (= 'off')
g:anyfold_fold_toplevel     | 0, 1    | 0 (= 'off')

                                                                *AnyFoldLoaded*
For expert configuration, AnyFold triggers an |autocmd-event| `AnyFoldLoaded`
after initialisation. This enables user-defined initialisation steps such as
    autocmd User AnyFoldLoaded normal zv
which unfolds the line in which the cursor is located when opening a file.
